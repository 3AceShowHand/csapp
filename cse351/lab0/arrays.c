// declaration of the assert function, stdio.h contains
// the declaration of the printf function, and stdlib.h
// contains the declaration of the malloc and free
// functions, all of which are used in the code below.

// looking it up from the array as in Java.

// here is int*, a pointer to an int. We'll learn more
// about why int* is used here, but for now it is enough
// to understand that array is an array of ints.

// Structs are blocks of memory composed of smaller parts,

// other types such as int or char.

// main is the entry point of the program. It has two
// parameters: argc is the number of arguments that were
// passed on the command line; argv is an array of those
// arguments as strings.  (Strings in C are arrays of
// chars.)

  // Create a new array capable of storing 10 elements
  // and fill it with values using the function declared
  // above. Arrays declared in this manner are allocated on
  // the stack, and must generally have a size (10, here)
  // that is a constant (i.e., the size is known when
  // writing the program, not computed when running it).
  int array[10];
  // This is a block of memory big enough to store 10
  // ints.  The name "array" here actually refers to the
  // address of this block of memory.
  // array[0] is the first int in this block of
  // memory, array[1] is the second, and so on. C does
  // not track or check array lengths, so it is up to us
  // to know how many elements the array contains.
  //
  // TODO(1): What happens if the second argument is set
  // to 11 instead? How about 100? 1000? Make sure to set
  // the second argument back to 10 when you are done
  // testing.
  // Answer:stack smashing detected.

  int value;
  // In C, we can take the address of something using the
  // & operator. &value is of the type int*, meaning that
  // it is a pointer to an integer (as it stores the
  // address in memory of where the actual int is located).
  //
  // TODO(2): We can actually use the address of the value
  // declared here as if it were an array of a single
  // element; why is this possible?
  // Answer: because fillArray function is working on a certain given int pointer with a 
  // certain length.Pointer and length are satified is ok.

  // Depending on whether or not you like to live
  // dangerously, the following is either exciting or
  // terrifying. Though &four_ints is of type FourInts*
  // (as in a pointer to a FourInts struct), we can
  // use a cast to pretend that it is actually an array
  // of integers instead.  It's all just memory after all.
  // The "(int*)" tells the C compiler that we want to treat
  // that address "&four_ints" as an address to an int (in
  // this case the start of an array) rather than a 
  // FourInts struct.

  // In the case that the size of an array is not known
  // until runtime, the malloc function can be used to
  // allocate memory dynamically. Memory that is
  // allocated dynamically is stored on the heap, which
  // is separate from the stack. We'll talk about all these
  // regions of memory later in the course.  C is unlike Java,
  // however, in that dynamically-allocated memory must
  // be freed explicitly when the program is done using
  // it via the free function. malloc takes a single
  // argument, which is the number of bytes to allocate,
  // and returns the address of a fresh memory object
  // whose size is the given argument.
  // sizeof(int) gives the size of an int in bytes
  // (which is four), so sizeof(int) * 5 is 20.

  // array, free the memory associated with it.

  // TODO(3): What happens if we remove the free
  // statement below? Try running "valgrind ./arrays"
  // after compiling the program both with and without
  // it. valgrind is a tool for analyzing how programs
  // use memory, which is often invaluable for C and
  // C++ programming.
  // Answer:
  free(heap_array);

  // TODO(4): Now it's your turn to write some code.
  // Using malloc, allocate a FourInts struct
  // dynamically (on the heap) and use fillArray to
  // populate it with values. The sizeof function can
  // be used on any data type. Make sure to free the
  // memory when you are done, and use the valgrind
  // tool mentioned above to check that there aren't
  // any errors. As a "sanity check," add four assert
  // statements to verify that the a, b, c, and d
  // fields of the FourInts struct are set to what
  // you would expect. (Hint, since you will have a
  // pointer to a FourInts struct you will need to
  // use the -> operator to access fields of a
  // FourInts* variable instead of the . operator
  // we used on the FourInts above.  ptr->a is 
  // equivalent to (*ptr).a .  Note the difference 
  // between FourInts and FourInts*.)
