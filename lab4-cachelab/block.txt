partition A AND C into 1 x bsize row silvers
partition B into bsize x bsize blocks


Load a block of B into the cache, uses it up, then discards it.

Reference to A enjoy good spatial locality because each silver is accessed with a stride of 1. There is also good temporal locality because the entire silver is referenced bsize times in succession.

References to B enjoy good temporal locality because the entire bsize x bsize block is accessed n times in succession.

References to C have good spatial locality because each element of the silver is written in succession. Do not have good temporal locality because each silver is only accessed one time.
